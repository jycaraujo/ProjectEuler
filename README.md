# ProjectEuler

Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. It includes over 670 problems, with a new one added once every one or two weeks. Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.

I started to solve project Euler to remember and improve my math skills trying to use optimal algorithms, notably not all algorithms are optimal, I'm always open to receive hints and rewrite the algorithms in a better way. I hope you enjoy it.
